* for assignment:

a piece of info exchanged b/w a client and a web service

the response by the service to the client contains headers
a cookie is a key-value pair sent back by the web service

sender then sends back a cookie called as "Sessiontoken" which has a value and the expirty time associated with it

cookies are a way of associating a "conversational" state with a request

so cookie can identify who is making the request and wants to talk to the web service

a cookie object can be injected in a get request to get more info about the cookie being exchanged

Automatic type conversion:
- http is a text based protocol where all uris are represented as strings
- sometime while writing handler methods it is more useful to use classes and not strings
- JAXRS impl looks at the formal arg type associated with injected values:
	- If they are not strings then the JAXRS runtime does try to convert them into an instance of a class
- Rules - slide 16 
	- auto convert String from uri request into some primitive type viz boolean, int, double etc
	- if you want to inject an arg as a class, then ok as long as it has one constructor which has one string arg
	- other rules static method value of - slide 17 of lecture 4 very important
	- collections can also be injected
