
framework of cms database


what table does the page get saved in before and after publish - understand how this works and locate this in the project
Hmm.....they seem to be on the same table (wp_posts) but the status column is different - find out why a draft can't be loaded

how to unpublish a page - go to the page and navigate to the status option on the right. Click edit and change it to "draft" from the drop down. Click Save draft and
then try reloadin the url

difference between web and application server 

http://www.diffen.com/difference/Application_Server_vs_Web_Server

A Web server is used to handle Http protocol (i.e process and respond requests made using the http protocol. Responses are in the form of HTML docs and objects
linked to it. Keeps HTML, PHP and ASP pages avialable on web browsers for viewing when users access the website)

Note that Apache is a web server

how are pages and themes linked? tables?

when ypu are creating your own template/theme - then how does that work?

base rule: all content must be content managed (text, video, audio, images etc)
ideally 3 days (1 day - then you are great)
make side tabs, upper tabs, set pages to these new tabs
 - each page's content should be different eg: video, images
 - content should be nice and presentable

to be done:
 - use cms to modify background, themes, use generic css
 	- how to use templates - learn this properly

to be done:	- 
-write javascript for your login - find out what is your login.php - this referes content of the login page
- login page must refer to content on the cms - redirect it to a page on your cms
