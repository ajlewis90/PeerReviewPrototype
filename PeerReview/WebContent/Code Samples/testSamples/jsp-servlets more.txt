

use jstl beans for my login class User and Resource Bundle

requestScope - implicit object, need not declare it and is an EL implicit object (EL = Expression Language)
another one is param ie a parameter implicit object

another one is sessionScope if value is to be accessed from the user's session - should be careful here since it would be present for the entire session

just put it into session if it is needed across different servlets

another one is headerValues, paramValues

WHy EL? it gracefully handles exception (Scripltlets do not do this as they would throw exceptions if they are not handled)


<%
		ResourceBundle rb = (ResourceBundle) session.getAttribute("language preference");
		
		response.addHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache,no-store,private,must-revalidate,max-stale=0,post-check=0,pre-check=0"); 
		response.addHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); 
		response.addDateHeader ("Expires", 0);
