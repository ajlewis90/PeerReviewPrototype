wordpress themes and templates:

A wordpress theme is a layout. It serves as a means to change the design of your website. But it does more than this.
Themes provide much more control over the look and presentation of website content.

A theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a GUI with a unifying design for the website.
These files are called "Template" files.

A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. 
Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), 
custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php)

Theme framework:
WordPress Themes typically consist of three main types of files, in addition to images and JavaScript files.

-The stylesheet called style.css, which controls the presentation (visual design and layout) of the website pages.
-WordPress template files which control the way the site pages generate the information from your WordPress database to be displayed on the site.
-The optional functions file (functions.php) as part of the WordPress Theme files.

templates:
- Templates are the files which control how your WordPress site will be displayed on the Web. 
- These files draw information from your WordPress MySQL database and generate the HTML code which is sent to the web browser. 
- WordPress allows you to define as few or as many Templates as you like all under one Theme. 
- Each of these Template files can be configured for use under specific situations

The wp_options table in the database stores the themes styles and settings

find out why the customization you apply overriddes the one from style.css


Theme features:
They are defined by theme authors to provide support to different features of a theme during customization via cms:
Features include:
- Custom backgrounds
- custom headers
- content width
- sidebars
- navigation menus
- post formats and thumbnails
- editor style

- A function called as add_theme_support() is used to support customization in functions.php

So, in case of the custom background feature, customization is provided for the bg color and image
- pass the 'custom-background' argument to the add_theme_support()
- and then add an array of default arguments to set elements like the default color, image etc

- The purpose of this call to add_theme_support() is to enable the Custom Background screen 
in the administrator's Appearance menu. 
- So, when admin sets up custom values for the theme, wordpress generates and extra sheet that is
in-line with the HTML headers (usually before the end of the doc's HEAD elemet)
- this extra css overrides the background values from style.css.

eg:
<style type="text/css" id="custom-background-css">
body.custom-background { background-color: #bdd96e; }
</style>
